Undergraduate students in my “Medievalism in Video Games: Art, Culture and Theory” course (HISTART 393) visited the [Computer and Video Games Archive](https://www.lib.umich.edu/locations-and-hours/computer-and-video-game-archive) (CVGA) this past fall. The CVGA is located inside the Shapiro Library and has a [rich collection of video games](https://search.lib.umich.edu/catalog?filter.collection=Video+Games+-+4th+Floor&filter.location=Shapiro&library=U-M+Ann+Arbor+Libraries), board games, and a [wide range of gaming consoles](https://www.lib.umich.edu/locations-and-hours/computer-and-video-game-archive/use-archive/game-systems) from the 1970s to the present day. The CVGA archivist and librarian, [David Carter](https://www.lib.umich.edu/users/superman), welcomed us and introduced the archive. Moreover, several copies of the newly released Assassin’s Creed: Mirage game were preordered in advance for class visit.

The historical events in [*Assassin’s Creed: Mirage*](https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3q7ANVXHm68MIG99qNrPCl/assassins-creed-mirage-introduces-history-of-baghdad-feature-to-bring-players-closer-to-history) are set in the ninth-century city of Baghdad during the Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258). To analyze the game, students first learned about Abbasid art and architecture and the round city of Baghdad in my seminar. Later, they experienced how certain historical sites, buildings and figures are represented thanks to historical texts and material evidence as well as their creative reimagination of [cultural heritage in a historical gaming](https://doi.org/10.1080/13642529.2017.1256615) context.
