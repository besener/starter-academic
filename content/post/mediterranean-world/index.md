Undergraduate students in my “Medievalism in Video Games: Art, Culture and Theory” course (HISTART 393) visited the [Computer and Video Games Archive](https://www.lib.umich.edu/locations-and-hours/computer-and-video-game-archive) (CVGA) this past fall. You may read more about it on the course website:[**Historical Video Games as Teaching Tools for Medieval Islamic Art and Architecture**](https://courses.lsa.umich.edu/medievalisminvideogames/historical-video-games-as-teaching-tools-for-medieval-islamic-art-and-architecture/).
