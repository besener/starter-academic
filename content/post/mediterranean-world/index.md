Northwestern undergraduate students in my "Art and Architecture of the Medieval Mediterranean” course (ART_HIST 329) visited the [Map/Geographic Information Room](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/visit/maps/university-library-lower-level/) at the University Library this past winter. My students examined various medieval and early modern maps while learning about the geographies of the Mediterranean. Prior to this hands-on session, Northwestern Library's [Geospatial and Cartographic Specialist](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/research/scholarly/geospatial-and-data-services.html), Mech Frazier, gave a guest lecture about geospatial analysis and ArcGIS StoryMaps in digital humanities.
