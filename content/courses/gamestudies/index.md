abstract:  "In this course, we study how real-life medieval monuments and images appear in the imagined spaces of video games. We learn about art and cultures of the middle ages while critically discussing related medieval images in video games through some key concepts and theories, including ludology (the social and cultural study of games), Orientalism, religion, race, identity, and woman and gender studies."
