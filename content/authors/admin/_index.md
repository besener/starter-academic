Hello! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in [History of Art](https://gsssh.ku.edu.tr/en/departments/archaeology-and-history-of-art/) at Koç University, and am currently a Freer visiting graduate student fellow in the Department of [History of Art](https://lsa.umich.edu/histart) at the University of Michigan. My dissertation aims to contextualize bronze mirrors within the lives of the inhabitants of medieval Anatolia. My research interests are the visual and material culture of the medieval Islamic world, including the collection and display of Islamic art in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, digital art history, digital tools and visualization.
